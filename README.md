A-B-Testing-for-Company1
Our favorite online shoe store, Company1 is performing an A/B Test. They have two different versions of an ad, which they have placed in emails, as well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They want to know how the two ads are performing on each of the different platforms on each day of the week. Help them analyze the data using aggregate measures.

The Product Manager wants to know which platform is getting the most views.

The Product Manager for the A/B test thinks that the clicks might have changed by day of the week.

You can see that ad A outperformed ad B on every day of the week except Tuesday and Sunday. It seems like as A is the better choice for Company1!
